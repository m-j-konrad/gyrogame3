# gyrogame3

Now it's done.
I'm working on another new version.
Still learning C++.
So the class structure will be planned before next time;
should make use of inheritance, too :-D
My code is still very "wild"...
----

Information:
 
- using a Sunfounder 2560 MEGA (compatible to Arduino MEGA) with
- Waveshare 4 inch TFT-Touch-Shield and
- GY61 ADXL335 Gyroscope (pins 13,14,15 - can be changed in <gyrogame.h>)
- Highscore is being stored in EEPROM now
- Score is saved as unsigned char, e.g. player score 230 is 23, but diplayed (score*10)
